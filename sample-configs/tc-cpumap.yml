# Notice: Choosing the queue size is very important when CPU is
# configured with power-saving states.
#
# If deepest state take 133 usec to wakeup from (133/10^6). When link
# speed is 10Gbit/s ((10*10^9/8) in bytes/sec). How many bytes can
# arrive with in 133 usec at this speed: (10*10^9/8)*(133/10^6) =
# 166250 bytes. With MTU size packets this is 110 packets, and with
# minimum Ethernet (incl intergap overhead) 84 bytes is 1979 packets.
#
# Setting default cpumap queue to 2048 as worst-case (small packet)
# should be +64 packet due kthread wakeup delay (due to xdp_do_flush)
# worst-case is 2043 packets.
#
# Sysadm can configured system to avoid deep-sleep via:
#   tuned-adm profile network-latency
