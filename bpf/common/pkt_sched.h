/* "Handles"
   ---------

    All the traffic control objects have 32bit identifiers, or "handles".

    They can be considered as opaque numbers from user API viewpoint,
    but actually they always consist of two fields: major and
    minor numbers, which are interpreted by kernel specially,
    that may be used by applications, though not recommended.

    F.e. qdisc handles always have minor number equal to zero,
    classes (or flows) have major equal to parent qdisc major, and
    minor uniquely identifying class inside qdisc.

    Macros to manipulate handles:
